Just a small word on the project.
=================================
Martin Spott posted a few months ago on the devel list a request for help (RFH ;-) to ease his task
with static model verification and insertion into our PostGIS DB. The goal is to automate, enhance
and accelerate the process.

Oliver (me) proposed his help and started to work first on the shared models. The experience gained
on this task should ease the following work on the 3D models import automation.

A "TODO" list has also been issued (TOBEDONE) which lists the tasks yet to be achieved in this
process.

Everyone with PHP - Ajax knowledge would be great - is welcome to help ;-)

How does it work ?
==================
Code:
-----
I tried to make the code as commented as possible. The code is not perfect, I'm not a PHP/PG expert,
but I tried to do my best I swear!

Directories:
------------
=> "ajax" => Containing all the work relative to Ajax (XML/PHP+JS).
=> "captcha" => Relative to Google's Recaptcha.
=> "inc" => Relative to the librairies used in this process (to make things easy, clean and "short").
=> "object" => Contains all the files (2) relative to the object position insertions.
=> "model" => The same, but for models.

Files
-----
Well, have a look at the file, I guess they are commented and easy enough to read. Else, let me know.
