- Form verification (Javacript+PHP).
- If offset is not set, nothing is inserted into the database.
- Wraps the email sent to the managersr to 77 characters maximum per line, but takes into account the
  URL (if URL's HTML is split, it doesn't work anymore).
- Contextual help (<a href> + cursor on item).
- Anti-XSS + SQLi functions.
- SQL is generated only if there is no false.

- Wrap emails to 77 chars per line only (except URL iot not cut them).
- For the "ob_text", mirroring "mo_name" from the corresponding model.
- No imperative relation between "mo_shared" and "ob_group", thus, in case of doubt, simply set "ob_group" to the integer "1".
- Inserted a "back" link to the submission page.
- Check the availability of the DB before all.
